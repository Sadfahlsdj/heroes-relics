# heroes-relics

A small mod that adds several weapons/items from a small indie turn-based JRPG.

Reading the wiki is HIGHLY recommended(but not required).

If you want to read tooltips(also highly recommended) use this: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tooltipfix

This is my first mod, so bugs are not so much of a nuisance as a certainty. In addition, this is entirely untested in multiplayer so please let me know about any game-breaking bugs and I'll do my best to ask someone else to help me fix them.
